1. What is a lesson you learned during this lab? You do not have to restrict
   your response to Python. It might be a lesson in time management, a lesson
   using CodeGrade, or something else.

   Getting the last code of line together it was a little difficult because I had to try to put in the function and the variable
   in the same line I had to go back to the feet_to_miles video for help
